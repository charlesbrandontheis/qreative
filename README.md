# Creative

Quantum computers have been used for creative projects. Here I make tools based on some of these projects, to make it easier for others to do similar things in future.

There are currently tools inspired by:
* [Battleships with partial NOT gates](https://medium.com/qiskit/how-to-program-a-quantum-computer-982a9329ed02)
* [Battleships with complementary measurements](https://medium.com/@decodoku/how-to-program-a-quantum-computer-part-2-f0d3eee872fe)
* [Quantum Battleships](https://medium.com/@decodoku/quantum-battleships-the-first-multiplayer-game-for-a-quantum-computer-e4d600ccb3f3)
* [Quantum Emoticons](https://medium.com/qiskit/making-a-quantum-computer-smile-cee86a6fc1de)

More will be added, based on both my own past projects and those of others.
